# Anitube UI Template

Anitube is a simple UI template inspired by the idea of a social media platform for anime lovers—think “YouTube, but for anime.” This project is meant to show off a basic concept for a site where anime fans can discover videos, view channels, and (in the future) connect with each other.

> **Note:**  
> This is only a design/prototype. It’s not a functional social media app, but a creative starting point!

## Features

- **Sidebar Menu:**  
  Navigation links for easy browsing. The links don't work yet.

- **Video Carousel:**  
  Highlighted videos displayed in a horizontal scrollable section.

- **Popular Channels View:**  
  Shows some popular (sample) channels as visual cards. Try clicking them.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** (vanilla, no frameworks)
